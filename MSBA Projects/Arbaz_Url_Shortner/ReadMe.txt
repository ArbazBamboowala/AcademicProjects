This is a small application that I had created during my time working as a Graduate Assistant for Texas A&M University.I worked on creating this by looking at the problem and performing a solution.
This is a locally created short url using Python FASTAPI.
There are various online tools used which does not have complete control and is controlled by third party.
This application is implemented locally so you can control everything and it gives you accurate results.

This project was implemented in second half of 2022

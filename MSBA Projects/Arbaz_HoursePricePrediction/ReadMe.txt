This is my House Price Prediction Project using Machine Learning Algorithms during my Masters of Science in Business Analytics.

I started by collecting data from various sources and integrated it into a single Excel sheet.
My primary aim for this project was to see if the prices will increase or decrease after Covid.

I started by implementing cleaning of data after it was collected

In this project you will see how I implemented hypothesis to predict house prices.
I also leveraged the use of Machine Learning Algorithms for predictions such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting algorithm, Decision Tree algorithm, Random Forest.

This project was implemented during first half of 2022

This is my project during my Masters, it was awarded as Second Best Project in my college.
My primary focus of this project was working with IOT and Python hence I implemented this unique project and practically implemented it in my college.
I initially started from scratch where I did not knew what to use although my vision was very much clear about it.
I started with researching hardware use, I understood the pin diagram of a Raspberry PI.
I learnt about how servo motor worked and I further went ahead by learning to control the servo motor using Python program.
I used Blink application to reduce my coding efforts as I already knew to program an application using Java.
There were multiple incidents where my raspberry pi failed, i blew up many electrical circuits due to incorrect pinning or programming.
Never gave up to leave it incomplete, further went ahead and bought new ones started again.
There are multiple applications using a small computer such as Raspberry PI.
Its a complete home automation system which controls Lights, Fans, Door and you door camera just like Ring Door Bell.
I would say this is a cheaper and better implementation then Ring Door Bell.
Whenever you are out of your home you can control your appliances or look for anyone coming at your home.
You can allow and open the door or close the door when they leave.

This project had been implemented in 2019 

Skills Used:

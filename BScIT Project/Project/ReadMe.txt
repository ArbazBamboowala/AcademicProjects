The project that I have created is helpful for tourists
Imagine a tourist has travelled all the way from one country to another and he only understands his native language.
I have taken here an example he only understands and reads English other than that he is unaware about different languages.
This project focuses on tourist having a phone with a working camera.
Tourist will click a picture and the code is in Java.
The picture is then converted into text using an OCR ( OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGINITION ).
The code is such that it understand that text and using google translator it translates it into tourists native language.

This project was made and implemented in 2017 and have been uploaded to google play store.
